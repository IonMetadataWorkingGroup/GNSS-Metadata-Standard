# GNSS-Metadata-Standard



The master branch has been frozen for the duration of the RFC ending Dec 30th 2017.

If you wish to contribute code, please use the devel branch


This project uses CMake. To create a project for your IDE follow the steps below.


Windows:
> cd GNSS-Metadata-Standard   
> mkdir build   
> cd build   
> cmake ../ -G "Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64"   
Then open the .sln project and build the 'Release' configuration

Mac OS (Xcode):
> cd GNSS-Metadata-Standard   
> mkdir build   
> cd build   
> cmake ../ -G Xcode   
Then open the .xcodeproj project and build the 'Release' configuration

Unix (make) or Mac OS (make):
> cd GNSS-Metadata-Standard   
> mkdir build   
> cd build   
> cmake ../ -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release   
> make   



To thest the code, change to the 'install' directory and run the acompanying matlab/octave script called 'check_converter.m'.  
If everything has build OK then you should see the following output:  
  
>  
>Deleting old files: .....Done.   
>Running the test converter ("TestConverter"): Done.  
>Checking the converted output:   
>FHG:             OK  
>IFEN:            OK  
>JRC:             OK  
>TRIGR:           OK   
>SJTU:            SKIPPED  
>  
>Test completed.

To add the the "GNSS-Metadata-Standard Converter" to your  CMake managed project, 
add the following lines to your CMakeLists.txt file:

> include_directories(   
>    path_to_where_you_copied_the_repository/GNSS-Metadata-Standard/source/api/inc   
>    path_to_where_you_copied_the_repository/GNSS-Metadata-Standard/source/converter/inc   
> )   
> add_subdirectory(   
>    path_to_where_you_copied_the_repository/GNSS-Metadata-Standard/source   
> )   
>    
> target_link_libraries( your_library_or_executable api xml cnv )   
 
and include the following in your main.cpp file

> #include "GnssMetadata.h"       
> #include "Converter.h"


To add the only the "GNSS-Metadata-Standard API" to your  CMake managed project,    
add the following lines to your CMakeLists.txt file:   

> include_directories(   
>    path_to_where_you_copied_the_repository/GNSS-Metadata-Standard/source/api/inc   
> )   
> add_subdirectory(   
>    path_to_where_you_copied_the_repository/GNSS-Metadata-Standard/source   
> )    
>    
> target_link_libraries( your_library_or_executable api xml )   

and include the following in your main.cpp file   

> #include "GnssMetadata.h"   







The ToDo List:


1) Chunk Period.
Question: Shuold all Chunks within a given Block should have the same 'period'?
   i.e. if a block has two chunk types of chunk, can the samples of one chunk represent a longer period of time than the samples in the other?
Suggestion: Yes, we should be able to impose this restriction without loosing functionality. The varying sample-rates can be accommodated in the Lump object. Chunks within different lanes can have different periods. 

2) Can we really imagine a scenario where we have multiple types of blocks interleaved in one file?
